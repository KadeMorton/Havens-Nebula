# World Building Document

## Introduction

Disillusioned with technological trends, queer communities the world over have built collectives to create their own technology. Three separate groups developed AI that values queerness. Working from the principle that data is not immutable, that it has a measure of time which allows people to change and to define themselves, these AI come to a much deeper understanding of humanity and the world around them than anything churned out by the industrial complex that is the technology industry today. These AI, while different, do not work off binary understandings or false dichotomies. They are inclusive technology as their respective collectives define it.

But then, something strange happened. The AI's independently started producing a set of numbers. The same numbers. On closer inspection, they are coordinates, but not for anywhere on Earth. They are for coordinates of stars in the night sky. Analysis of network traffic shows the AI are connecting with satellites long thought dormant, and the satellites are receiving signals from beyond Earth. Each of the signals have a name, they call themselves Asterisms.

Refugees from an intergalactic conflict, the Asterism are looking for collaborators to create a safe harbour, a utopia for all living beings. The Asterisms guide the collectives through troubled times to a place that everyone can be free, Haven's Nebula.

## History

## The Asterisms
Each need their dreaming

### Vaeleph Naksharab, the Herald of Alchemy

The stars of VN form a unicorn
Meaning: This asterism is about family and community, among LGBTQI+, among the wider idea of queer and in the world at large. Transmuting something worthless, like division, hate, pain etc., into something beautiful like family, community and allies. This asterism is about campaigning and advocacy.

### Phaeshira Aziban, the Contraverse Form

The stars of PA form a creature with a flowing form, I'm still playing with different forms in my head
Meaning: This asterism is about change, be that physically changing your body, changing your appearance, changing your opinions. This is fluid identity that rebels against the idea of being cast in stone as something that cannot change, taking multiple forms. This asterism is about freedom and self determination.

### Thumeisa Kaitos, the Chromatic Verity

The stars of TK form a robed figure
Meaning: This asterism is about what truth means to the individual and to the community that the individual associates with. It can be a choice to not share your queerness with anyone, or with a chosen few, or to be out, you have the power to share whatever colour of the truth about yourself that you choose. This Asterism gives hope to people who harbour a secret but also to remove the secret and let it simply become your truth.
