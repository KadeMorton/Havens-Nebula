### Overview
Haven's Nebula is a thought experiment around queering. The Queering Space at MozFest 2018 inspired a number of us to carry on the tradition, and this time around we got to plan a distinct theme. We knew we couldn't do unicorns because 2019 had to differentiate itself from 2018. One of the queering team for this year suggested stars as a path to liberation as a theme, immediately I was able to run with that. The below is what we came up with.

Disillusioned with technological trends, queer communities the world over have built collectives to create their own technology. Three separate groups developed AI that values queerness. Working from the principle that data is not immutable, that it has a measure of time which allows people to change and to define themselves, these AI come to a much deeper understanding of humanity and the world around them than anything churned out by the industrial complex that is the technology industry today. These AI, while different, do not work off binary understandings or false dichotomies. They are inclusive technology as their respective collectives define it. 

But then, something strange happened. The AI's independently started producing a set of numbers. The same numbers. On closer inspection, they are coordinates, but not for anywhere on Earth. They are for coordinates of stars in the night sky. Analysis of network traffic shows the AI are connecting with satellites long thought dormant, and the satellites are receiving signals from beyond Earth. Each of the signals have a name, they call themselves Asterisms. 

Refugees from an intergalactic conflict, the Asterism are looking for collaborators to create a safe harbour, a utopia for all living beings. The Asterisms guide the collectives through troubled times to a place that everyone can be free, Haven's Nebula.

### MozFest

The space description from the [MozFest Website](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/spaces/queering/):

Welcome to Haven's Nebula!

As many oppressed communities did in the past, we are following the stars to set us free. Together, we are building more inclusive tech, better machine decision making and safe digital spaces that bring us closer to collective liberation. Haven's Nebula is a space to connect, build community, relax, and navigate the queering experience across MozFest.

Propose a session and build community through performance, discussion, learning, and friendship. This space comes from a foundation of radical inclusion through a queer lens, and the purpose of Havenâ€™s Nebula is to light the way to collective liberation.

Connect to a constellation of people, find your guiding star and join us in creating the inclusive world we want.


#### Asterisms at MozFest

fix up
Reasoning: Asterism is the official term for small constellations. And unlike constellations, they are not fixed. There is no official international body that recognises them, they are a complete social construct that people choose to by into. The three of us can choose to recognise a particular group of stars as our Asterism of anything we like, and others can recognise if they choose, or recognise some or all of those same stars as a completely different Asterism.

Vaeleph Naksharab, the Herald of Alchemy
The stars of VN form a unicorn
Meaning: This asterism is about family and community, among LGBTQI+, among the wider idea of queer and in the world at large. Transmuting something worthless, like division, hate, pain etc., into something beautiful like family, community and allies. This asterism is about campaigning and advocacy.

Phaeshira Aziban, the Contraverse Form
The stars of PA form a creature with a flowing form, I'm still playing with different forms in my head
Meaning: This asterism is about change, be that physically changing your body, changing your appearance, changing your opinions. This is fluid identity that rebels against the idea of being cast in stone as something that cannot change, taking multiple forms. This asterism is about freedom and self determination.

Thumeisa Kaitos, the Chromatic Verity
The stars of TK form a robed figure
Meaning: This asterism is about what truth means to the individual and to the community that the individual associates with. It can be a choice to not share your queerness with anyone, or with a chosen few, or to be out, you have the power to share whatever colour of the truth about yourself that you choose. This Asterism gives hope to people who harbour a secret but also to remove the secret and let it simply become your truth.

#### The constellation
All the people in the space are Haven's Constellation
Reasoning: Collectively we all comprise a unit of measurement greater than an asterism, being a constellation. Yes constellations are fixed but we are just going to declare ourselves a constellation, we will put our sunglasses on and people can deal with it.

#### The Queering Space at Mozfest

Fix up
The Queering Zone - Haven's Nebula

The physical space is called Haven's Nebula
Reasoning: Nebulas appear nice and soft, so we have the tactile element of the space. Nebulas are where stars are born so we have homecoming, haven is part of the theme below. Nebulas are also colourful so we have license for rainbows and everything else.
Supporting: To bring out the fluffy nature of nebulas I think beanbags, if we can get them cheap, or cushions, are a must. Big and soft is what we want.

##### Entering the Queering Space

Coming Soon.

Haven's Nebula is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 and its use under this license is encouraged. We want people in the queering space to engage with this theme, and connect with the overall concept of queering in a way they maybe haven't before. We encourage people to use this document to write stories set in Haven's Nebula, create artwork that represents the Nebula, and dive into this theme in ways we have never even thought of yet. We will display as much of it as we can in the space during MozFest itself. Send your submissions to me at kademorton at protonmail dot com.
