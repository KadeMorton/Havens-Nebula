### Overview
Haven's Nebula is a thought experiment around queering. The Queering Space at MozFest 2018 inspired a number of us to carry on the tradition, and this time around we got to plan a distinct theme. We knew we couldn't do unicorns because 2019 had to differentiate itself from 2018. One of the queering team for this year suggested stars as a path to liberation as a theme, immediately I was able to run with that. The below is what we came up with.

Disillusioned with technological trends, queer communities the world over have built collectives to create their own technology. Three separate groups developed AI that values queerness. Working from the principle that data is not immutable, that it has a measure of time which allows people to change and to define themselves, these AI come to a much deeper understanding of humanity and the world around them than anything churned out by the industrial complex that is the technology industry today. These AI, while different, do not work off binary understandings or false dichotomies. They are inclusive technology as their respective collectives define it. 

But then, something strange happened. The AI's independently started producing a set of numbers. The same numbers. On closer inspection, they are coordinates, but not for anywhere on Earth. They are for coordinates of stars in the night sky. Analysis of network traffic shows the AI are connecting with satellites long thought dormant, and the satellites are receiving signals from beyond Earth. Each of the signals have a name, they call themselves Asterisms. 

Refugees from an intergalactic conflict, the Asterism are looking for collaborators to create a safe harbour, a utopia for all living beings. The Asterisms guide the collectives through troubled times to a place that everyone can be free, Haven's Nebula.

### MozFest

The space description from the [MozFest Website](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/spaces/queering/):

Welcome to Haven's Nebula!

As many oppressed communities did in the past, we are following the stars to set us free. Together, we are building more inclusive tech, better machine decision making and safe digital spaces that bring us closer to collective liberation. Haven's Nebula is a space to connect, build community, relax, and navigate the queering experience across MozFest.

Propose a session and build community through performance, discussion, learning, and friendship. This space comes from a foundation of radical inclusion through a queer lens, and the purpose of Havenâ€™s Nebula is to light the way to collective liberation.

Connect to a constellation of people, find your guiding star and join us in creating the inclusive world we want.

#### Asterisms at MozFest

##### The word "Asterism"

The syndicates of the 2018 Decentralisation Zone resonated well with attendees. I wanted to build on this idea for the 2019 Queering Space, and as we were running with the idea of stars the idea of constellations jumped out at me. However, constellations are quite large and they are quite rigid. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines official constellations, having mapped the entire sky, leaving zero room for anything but their official interpretation. As queerness is often about subversion, that doesn't feel very queer at all. On further reading I came across the below:

In observational astronomy, an [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_%28astronomy%29) is a popularly-known pattern or group of stars that can be seen in the night sky. This colloquial definition makes it appear quite similar to a constellation, but they differ mostly in that a constellation is an officially recognized area of the sky, while an asterism is a visually obvious collection of stars and the lines used to mentally connect them; as such, asterisms do not have officially determined boundaries and are therefore a more general concept which may refer to any identified pattern of stars. 

Something that can be self-defined, that groups can choose to recognise based on shared understandings and values that can be ascribed shared meaning and are controlled by no official body? Yes! However (again), the word asterism does not have nearly the same level of brand recognition that the word constellation does, so we expect the two will be used interchangeably. But language is important, so we have the word asterism for those that what to use it.

##### So what are the asterisms?

As per the story in our overview, the asterisms are introduced as refugees from an intergalactic conflict, looking for collaborators to create a safe harbour, a utopia for all living beings. They are benevolent entities from beyond the stars, queering the idea of 'the other' being inherently evil and dangerous, and they want to help us build a sanctuary that we can take shelter in, should we want to. As people have used the stars for navigation for many years, be it [wayfinding by the stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesian_navigation#Navigation_by_the_stars) or by [following the North Star to escape slavery](https://www.voanews.com/a/escaped-slaves-followed-the-north-star-to-freedom-in-northern-states-and-canada-84249287/162640.html) the Asterisms have come to guide us to collective liberation. 

There are three distinct asterisms that have made contact with the human race, each with their own stars, their own histories and their own personalities. They are listed below. People can choose to associate with one or more of the asterisms, depending on what speaks to them.

##### Vaeleph Naksharab, the Herald of Alchemy

The first asterism to make contact with humanity called themselves Vaeleph Naksharab. They explained to the collective of queer technologists contacted that their name, translated into human languages means "the herald of alchemy". Vaeleph firmly believes in relationships, that we can all be better versions of ourselves in the context of others. It was Vaeleph's idea to make contact with humanity in the first instance to help them reach and build Haven's Nebula. Vaeleph builds coalitions, transmuting ugly things like hate and pain into beautiful things like family and community. The stars of their home system, seen from the earth, appear as a unicorn.

Vaeleph was created to be a broad banner that people, queer and those that don't identify as queer, could associate under. Their underpinning theme is community, campaigning and advocacy, which can change situations for the better. The shape of their asterism, the unicorn, as well as being a very popular pride symbol, is a reference to the giant unicorn in the Queering Space last year. While this year we can't just be unicorns, we can still have unicorns!

##### Phaeshira Aziban, the Contraverse Form

Contact with Phaeshira was first noticed when the datasets the queer collective's AI were using began to display aberrations. Change is literally Phaeshira's language. The meaning of Phaeshira Aziban, translated into human tongues has multiple interpretations, and the ambiguous translation of "the Contraverse Form" is usually settled on. Phaeshira rebels against static definitions, seeing them as the bedrock of power structures, and prefers fluidity. They believe in changing appearances, physical form and even changing ideas. Freedom and self-determination are the ideals Phaeshira holds dear. The stars of their home system, seen from the earth, appear as many different things, but seem to be an amorphous creature.

Phaeshira was created to push the alien element of the asterisms, and to give people that feel alienated and acutely different from others a banner to rally around. Their underpinning theme is difference, choice and ultimately acceptance. Phaeshira will mark the Queering Space as definitely "queer" in the traditional sense of "different", broadening the definition of queer away from just sexual and gender minorities, which was an explicit goal for the Queering Space team.

##### Thumeisa Kaitos, the Chromatic Verity

Potentially the subtlest of the asterisms, Thumeisa chose to make contact with the humans to reveal many truths to them, but most who have studied Thumeisa will admit they do not know all their truths. Thumeisa has secrets and is very selective in sharing information. But what they do share holds profound wisdom. One of the secrets Thumeisa has shared is their full name, Thumeisa Kaitos, which humans have taken to mean "the Chromatic Verity" or the colourful truth. Thumeisa values self-sovereignty, believing all living beings express themselves through information, what is and isn't shared. This choice is that person's, and that person's alone, and that privacy is paramount to identity and self. The stars of their home system, seen from the earth, appear as a figure shrouded in robes.

Thumeisa was created such that people with secrets can still identify with the Queering Space theme without needing to disclose them. Potentially living a double life or whether or not people choose to be out is a big part of queer culture, and in many parts of the world it still isn't safe to be out. Thumeisa gives hope to people who harbour a secret but also allows for the secret to reframed, removing the secret and letting it simply become that person's truth.

#### The Queering Space at MozFest

The space itself will be called Haven's Nebula. This is the world humanity has built in collaboration with the asterisms as our safe space. We want the space to be quiet, soft, comfortable and tactile, to evoke the feeling of homecoming. We went with the word nebula as stars are born in nebulas, so they are the 'home' of our theme. Nebulas are colourful which gives us license to go crazy with rainbows and the like. And while they may not be in actual fact, nebulas also look fluffy and soft, which adds to expectations of the space. On hearing the name of the space you have an idea of what you are going to get. The design of the physical space will be informed by these ideas.

Haven's Nebula is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 and its use under this license is encouraged. We want people in the queering space to engage with this theme, and connect with the overall concept of queering in a way they maybe haven't before. We encourage people to use this document to write stories set in Haven's Nebula, create artwork that represents the Nebula, and dive into this theme in ways we have never even thought of yet. We will display as much of it as we can in the space during MozFest itself. Send your submissions to me at kademorton at protonmail dot com.
