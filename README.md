### Overview
Haven's Nebula is a thought experiment around queering. The Queering Space at MozFest 2018 inspired a number of us to carry on the tradition, and this time around we got to plan a distinct theme. We knew we couldn't do unicorns because 2019 had to differentiate itself from 2018. One of the queering team for this year suggested stars as a path to liberation as a theme, immediately I was able to run with that. The below is what we came up with.

Disillusioned with technological trends, queer communities the world over have built collectives to create their own technology. Three separate groups developed AI that values queerness. Working from the principle that data is not immutable, that it has a measure of time which allows people to change and to define themselves, these AI come to a much deeper understanding of humanity and the world around them than anything churned out by the industrial complex that is the technology industry today. These AI, while different, do not work off binary understandings or false dichotomies. They are inclusive technology as their respective collectives define it. 

But then, something strange happened. The AI's independently started producing a set of numbers. The same numbers. On closer inspection, they are coordinates, but not for anywhere on Earth. They are for coordinates of stars in the night sky. Analysis of network traffic shows the AI are connecting with satellites long thought dormant, and the satellites are receiving signals from beyond Earth. Each of the signals have a name, they call themselves Asterisms. 

Refugees from an intergalactic conflict, the Asterism are looking for collaborators to create a safe harbour, a utopia for all living beings. The Asterisms guide the collectives through troubled times to a place that everyone can be free, Haven's Nebula.

### MozFest

The space description from the [MozFest Website](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/spaces/queering/):

Welcome to Haven's Nebula!

As many oppressed communities did in the past, we are following the stars to set us free. Together, we are building more inclusive tech, better machine decision making and safe digital spaces that bring us closer to collective liberation. Haven's Nebula is a space to connect, build community, relax, and navigate the queering experience across MozFest.

Propose a session and build community through performance, discussion, learning, and friendship. This space comes from a foundation of radical inclusion through a queer lens, and the purpose of Havenâ€™s Nebula is to light the way to collective liberation.

Connect to a constellation of people, find your guiding star and join us in creating the inclusive world we want.

#### Asterisms at MozFest

##### The word "Asterism"

The syndicates of the 2018 Decentralisation Zone resonated well with attendees. I wanted to build on this idea for the 2019 Queering Space, and as we were running with the idea of stars the idea of constellations jumped out at me. However, constellations are quite large and they are quite rigid. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines official constellations, having mapped the entire sky, leaving zero room for anything but their official interpretation. As queerness is often about subversion, that doesn't feel very queer at all. On further reading I came across the below:

In observational astronomy, an [asterism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterism_%28astronomy%29) is a popularly-known pattern or group of stars that can be seen in the night sky. This colloquial definition makes it appear quite similar to a constellation, but they differ mostly in that a constellation is an officially recognized area of the sky, while an asterism is a visually obvious collection of stars and the lines used to mentally connect them; as such, asterisms do not have officially determined boundaries and are therefore a more general concept which may refer to any identified pattern of stars. 

Something that can be self defined, that groups can choose to recognise based on shared understandings and values, that can be ascribed shared meaning and are controlled by no official body? Yes! However (again), the word asterism does not have nearly the same level of brand recognition that the word constellation does, so we expect the two will be used interchangibly. But language is important, so we have the word asterism for those that what to use it.

##### So what are the asterisms?

As per the story in our overview, the asterisms are introduced as refugees from an intergalactic conflict, looking for collaborators to create a safe harbour, a utopia for all living beings. They are benevolent entities from beyond the stars, queering the idea of 'the other' being inherently evil and dangerous, and they want to help us build a sanctuary that we can take shelter in, should we want to. As people have used the stars for navigation for many years, be it [wayfinding by the stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesian_navigation#Navigation_by_the_stars) or by [following the North Star to escape slavery](https://www.voanews.com/a/escaped-slaves-followed-the-north-star-to-freedom-in-northern-states-and-canada-84249287/162640.html) the Asterisms have come to guide us to collective liberation. 

There are three distinct asterisms that have made contact with the human race, each with their own stars, their own histories and their own personalities. They are listed below. People can choose to associate with one or more of the asterisms, depending on what speaks to them.

##### Vaeleph Naksharab, the Herald of Alchemy
The first asterism to make contact with humanity called themselves Vaeleph Naksharab. They explained to the collective of queer technologists contacted that their name, translated into human languages means "the herald of alchemy". Vaeleph firmly believes in relationships, that we can all be better versions of ourselves in the context of others. It was Vaeleph's idea to make contact with humanity in the first instance to help them reach and build Haven's Nebula. Vaeleph builds coalitions, transmuting ugly things like hate and pain into beutiful things like family and community. The stars of their home system, seen from the earth, appear as a unicorn.

Vaeleph was created to be a broad banner that people, queer and those that don't identify was queer, could associate under. Their underpinning theme is community, campaigning and advocacy, which can change situations for the better. The shape of their asterism, the unicorn, as well as being a very popular pride symbol, is a reference to the giant unicorn in the Queering Space last year. While this year we can't just be unicorns, we can still have unicorns!

##### Phaeshira Aziban, the Contraverse Form
Contact with Phaeshira was first noticed when the datasets the queer collective's AI were using began to display aberations. Change is literally Phaeshira's language. The meaning of Phaeshira Aziban, translated into human tongues has multiple interpretations, and the ambiguous translation of "the Contraverse Form" is usually settled on. Phaeshira rebels against static definitions, seeing them as the bedrock of power structures, and prefers fluidity. They believe in chaging appearances, physical form and even changing ideas. Freedom and self determination are the ideals Phaeshira holds dear. The stars of their home system, seen from the earth, appear as many different things, but seem to be an amorphous creature.

Phaeshira was created to push the alien element of the asterisms, and to give people that feel alienated and accutely different from others a banner to rally around. Their underpinning theme is difference, choice and ultimately acceptance. Phaeshira will mark the Queering Space as definitely "queer" in the traditional sense of "different", broadening the definition of queer away from just sexual and gender minorities, which was an explicit goal for the Queering Space team.

##### Thumeisa Kaitos, the Chromatic Verity

The stars of PA form a creature with a flowing form, I'm still playing with different forms in my head
Meaning: This asterism is about change, be that physically changing your body, changing your appearance, changing your opinions. This is fluid identity that rebels against the idea of being cast in stone as something that cannot change, taking multiple forms. This asterism is about freedom and self determination.

Thumeisa Kaitos, the Chromatic Verity
The stars of TK form a robed figure
Meaning: This asterism is about what truth means to the individual and to the community that the individual associates with. It can be a choice to not share your queerness with anyone, or with a chosen few, or to be out, you have the power to share whatever colour of the truth about yourself that you choose. This Asterism gives hope to people who harbour a secret but also to remove the secret and let it simply become your truth.

#### The constellation
All the people in the space are Haven's Constellation
Reasoning: Collectively we all comprise a unit of measurement greater than an asterism, being a constellation. Yes constellations are fixed but we are just going to declare ourselves a constellation, we will put our sunglasses on and people can deal with it.

#### The Queering Space at Mozfest

Fix up
The Queering Zone - Haven's Nebula

The physical space is called Haven's Nebula
Reasoning: Nebulas appear nice and soft, so we have the tactile element of the space. Nebulas are where stars are born so we have homecoming, haven is part of the theme below. Nebulas are also colourful so we have license for rainbows and everything else.
Supporting: To bring out the fluffy nature of nebulas I think beanbags, if we can get them cheap, or cushions, are a must. Big and soft is what we want.

##### Entering the Queering Space

Coming Soon.

We want people in the queering space to engage with this theme, and connect with the overall concept of queering in a way they maybe haven't before. We encourage people to use this document to write stories set in Haven's Nebula, create artwork that represents the Nebula, and dive into this theme in ways we have never even thought of yet. We will display as much of it as we can in the space during MozFest itself. Send your submissions to me at kademorton at protonmail dot com.
