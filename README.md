### Overview
Haven's Nebula is a thought experiment around queering. The Queering Space at MozFest 2018 inspired a number of us to carry on the tradition, and this time around we got to plan a distinct theme. We knew we couldn't do unicorns because 2019 had to differentiate itself from 2018. One of the queering team for this year suggested stars as a path to liberation as a theme, immediately I was able to run with that. The below is what we came up with.

Disillusioned with technological trends, queer communities the world over have built collectives to create their own technology. Three separate groups developed AI that values queerness. Working from the principle that data is not immutable, that it has a measure of time which allows people to change and to define themselves, these AI come to a much deeper understanding of humanity and the world around them than anything churned out by the industrial complex that is the technology industry today. These AI, while different, do not work off binary understandings or false dichotomies. They are inclusive technology as their respective collectives define it. 

But then, something strange happened. The AI's independently started producing a set of numbers. The same numbers. On closer inspection, they are coordinates, but not for anywhere on Earth. They are for coordinates of stars in the night sky. Analysis of network traffic shows the AI are connecting with satellites long thought dormant, and the satellites are receiving signals from beyond Earth. Each of the signals have a name, they call themselves Asterisms. 

Refugees from an intergalactic conflict, the Asterism are looking for collaborators to create a safe harbour, a utopia for all living beings. The Asterisms guide the collectives through troubled times to a place that everyone can be free, Haven's Nebula.

### MozFest

The space description from the [MozFest Website](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/spaces/queering/):

Welcome to Haven's Nebula!

As many oppressed communities did in the past, we are following the stars to set us free. Together, we are building more inclusive tech, better machine decision making and safe digital spaces that bring us closer to collective liberation. Haven's Nebula is a space to connect, build community, relax, and navigate the queering experience across MozFest.

Propose a session and build community through performance, discussion, learning, and friendship. This space comes from a foundation of radical inclusion through a queer lens, and the purpose of Havenâ€™s Nebula is to light the way to collective liberation.

Connect to a constellation of people, find your guiding star and join us in creating the inclusive world we want.

Haven's Nebula is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 and its use under this license is encouraged. We want people in the queering space to engage with this theme, and connect with the overall concept of queering in a way they maybe haven't before. We encourage people to use this document to write stories set in Haven's Nebula, create artwork that represents the Nebula, and dive into this theme in ways we have never even thought of yet. We will display as much of it as we can in the space during MozFest itself. Send your submissions to me at kademorton at protonmail dot com.
