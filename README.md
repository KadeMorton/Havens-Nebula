# Havens-Nebula
Open World for the Mozfest 2019 Queering Space

The Queering Zone - Haven's Nebula

The physical space is called Haven's Nebula
Reasoning: Nebulas appear nice and soft, so we have the tactile element of the space. Nebulas are where stars are born so we have homecoming, haven is part of the theme below. Nebulas are also colourful so we have license for rainbows and everything else.
Supporting: To bring out the fluffy nature of nebulas I think beanbags, if we can get them cheap, or cushions, are a must. Big and soft is what we want.

Story: (words are not perfect, this is the outline of the idea) Disillusioned with technological trends, queer communities the world over build collectives to create their own technology. Three separate groups develop AI that values queerness. Working from the principle that data is not immutable, that it has a measure of time and allows people to change and to define themselves, these AI come to a much deeper understanding of humanity and the world around them than anything churned out by the industrial complex that is technology today. These AI, while different, do not work off binary understandings or false dichotomies. They are inclusive technology as the collective define it. But then, something strange happened. The AI's independently start producing three sets of numbers. On closer inspection, they are coordinates, but not for anywhere on Earth. They are for coordinates of stars in the night sky. Analysis of network traffic shows the AI are connecting with satellites long thought dormant, and the satellites are receiving signals from beyond Earth. Each of the signals have a name, they call themselves Asterisms. Refugees from an intergalactic conflict, the Asterism are looking for allies to create a safe harbour, a utopia for all living beings. The Asterisms give the collectives hope and guide them through troubled times to a place that everyone can be free, Haven's Nebula.
Reasoning: Asterism is the official term for small constellations. And unlike constellations, they are not fixed. There is no official international body that recognises them, they are a complete social construct that people choose to by into. The three of us can choose to recognise a particular group of stars as our Asterism of anything we like, and others can recognise if they choose, or recognise some or all of those same stars as a completely different Asterism.

The Three Asterisms of Haven's Nebula
Vaeleph Naksharab, the Herald of Alchemy
The stars of VN form a unicorn
Meaning: This asterism is about family and community, among LGBTQI+, among the wider idea of queer and in the world at large. Transmuting something worthless, like division, hate, pain etc., into something beautiful like family, community and allies. This asterism is about campaigning and advocacy.

Phaeshira Aziban, the Contraverse Form
The stars of PA form a creature with a flowing form, I'm still playing with different forms in my head
Meaning: This asterism is about change, be that physically changing your body, changing your appearance, changing your opinions. This is fluid identity that rebels against the idea of being cast in stone as something that cannot change, taking multiple forms. This asterism is about freedom and self determination.

Thumeisa Kaitos, the Chromatic Verity
The stars of TK form a robed figure
Meaning: This asterism is about what truth means to the individual and to the community that the individual associates with. It can be a choice to not share your queerness with anyone, or with a chosen few, or to be out, you have the power to share whatever colour of the truth about yourself that you choose. This Asterism gives hope to people who harbour a secret but also to remove the secret and let it simply become your truth.

Each of the asterisms will have a Dreaming, which is a creation story (as told by Australian Aborigines with particular elements that make it a dreaming more than just linear story). These are coming.

All the people in the space are Haven's Constellation
Reasoning: Collectively we all comprise a unit of measurement greater than an asterism, being a constellation. Yes constellations are fixed but we are just going to declare ourselves a constellation, we will put our sunglasses on and people can deal with it.

Based on all this: Space Description
Welcome to the Haven's Nebula, a manifestation of collective liberation. Inclusive AI built by queer communities have opened contact with the Asterism, wayfarers from cross the stars that offer to guide one and all to an enlightened future. This space is for connecting, socializing, downtime, and for navigation as you orientate yourself for the queering experience across Mozfest. Haven's Nebula has come from a foundation of radical inclusion through a queer lens. Propose a session and build community through performance, discussion, learning and friendship. Join a constellation of people, find your guiding star and join us in creating the inclusive world we want.

Overall notes: The cultures that really came through from my brief reading were Egyptian, Arabic, Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, and Polynesian (Australian Aborigine (though they would dispute being called Polynesian, I'm lumping together geography) Maori and Hawaiian) as they really focused on astronomy. I tried to weave in all the elements we discussed in person, like using the stars to escape slavery and while there are some elements in names names I steered largely clear of Greek and Roman astrology due to it being the foundation of what we know as Western astronomy today. If anyone feels the above isn't representative enough now is the time to voice it.

Please shred and we can work from there.
